In no particular order:
-----------------------

-> If navigating back from preferences:
   - include a boolean flag true if any preference was changed.
   - the Meetings view model detects that and refreshes state accordingly.

   If navigating back from Races or Runners, there's no need for the Meetings view model to do the
   preference check.

-> Have items in the Preferences screen as individual, e.g. as Card.
