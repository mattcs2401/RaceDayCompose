App Notes

In no particular order.
-----------------------

-> If navigating back to the Meetings screen from anything but the Settings screen, there's no need
   for the Meetings view model to do the preference check.
   -- is it really that big an overhead ?
      -- maybe if we start getting a whole list of preferences ?
         -- what about some sort of preference manager ?
            -- TBA

-> Save scroll position/state, for listings.
   -- e.g. when navigate from Runners back to Races.

-> Implement a 'Summary' screen of selected Races.

-> Summaries are grouped by 'meetingCode' (hard coded):
   -- can we make this more dynamic ?

-> Summary / Notifications actions when:
   -- Race time is nearing.
   -- Race time is past.

-> Implement an Admin screen:
   -- TBA.

-> Implement a search function:
   -- horse
   -- jockey
   -- ??
