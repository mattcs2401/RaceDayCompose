-> If navigating back to the Meetings screen from anything but the Settings screen, there's no need
   for the Meetings view model to do the preference check.
   -- is it really that big an overhead ?
      -- maybe if we start getting a whole list of preferences ?
         -- what about some sort of preference manager ?
            -- TBA

-> Save scroll position/state, for long listings.

-> Implement a 'Summary' screen of selected Races.

-> Implement Notifications based on what is current in the Summary.

-> Implement a search function:
   -- horse
   -- jockey
   -- ??
