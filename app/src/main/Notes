-> If navigating back from preferences:
   - include boolean flags if any preference was changed (i.e. true if preference was changed).
   - the Meetings view model detects that and refreshes state accordingly.

   If navigating back from Races or Runners, there's no need for the Meetings view model to do the
   preference check.

-> Put abandoned Meetings to the bottom of the list.

-> Save scroll position/state, for long listings.

-> TBA
